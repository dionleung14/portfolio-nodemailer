### Components

A reflection coming soon

### Styling

Styling was done primarily with Tailwind CSS through npm. I spent several hours working on a React-state-based feature for dark mode toggling. I was actually pretty proud of it, but then Tailwind had to come out with their own version of dark mode \*_shakes fist_\* I still have not tried it out though, so the dark mode you see on my portfolio is custom made!

I used a ton of other resources to create my portfolio, including but not limited to https://favicon.io/ for my custom favicons, https://coolors.co/ to help me pick out a custom color palette, and https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners for a nifty animation when you submit a contact form.

### Planned updates

Currently, I am adding a couple of different pages to illustrate the extent of my projects. I have a portfolio page planned that will be a more comprehensive list of my works, and an archive page where I will showcase most of my works in reverse chronological order. The archive page is meant to illustrate my development and growth, while also serving as possible inspiration for future projects, whereas the portfolio page will be a larger collection of works most relevant to my career goals at the time.

### Additional comments and notes

The creation of this website was made possible by using Tailwind CSS Framework.
