    "The final project of the bootcamp, RocketList combines a React frontend with a GraphQL and Apollo backend, with a live chat feature through Socket.io.This app won both the award for Best Functionality and the People's Choice Award.",
    "Coined as a combination of the best parts of Reddit, Yahoo Answers, and Craigslist, registered users can create posts, respond to existing posts, and even join a live chatroom specific to the post at hand. This open-endedness connects people seeking services, advice, or general thoughts/reactions from the internet. A chat feature was introduced to decrease the likelihood of off-topic replies to a post, with users urged to summarize the happenings in a chat.",
    "Styling was done primarily through Tailwind CSS, with loading animations coming from react-spinners as an npm package. Other features and packages used include popper.js, query-string, and react-emoji. I served as part of the frontend team, handling requests and focusing on mobile layout/optimization. I also was responsible for the custom rocket animation in the logo.",
