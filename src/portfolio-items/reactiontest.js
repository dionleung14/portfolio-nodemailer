    "This mini-project is a quick exercise and demonstration of using Vue.js, as well as me practicing JavaScript timers. I was inspired by one of my friends sending me a link to a site that would test my reaction speed, useful for online gaming. However, I was (wrongfully) worried that it would be a jump scare. Once I determined it was legitimate, I thought it would be a fun idea to create a similar version that actually IS a jump scare.",
    "Feel free to send the link to your friends (or enemies) to get their hearts racing for a little bit! If you enter 'charizard' as the password, you will bypass the jumpscare and be able to complete the reaction test without worrying about the jump scare.",
    "I used scoped styling for each .vue component, which helped me practice my vanilla CSS.",
