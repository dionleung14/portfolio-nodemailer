  description: [
    "One of my first freelance projects, EPIC Physical Therapy was seeking a complete overhaul of their website. At the time, their website was poorly maintained and in a state of disarray with outdated information and poorly laid out.",
    "My solution and proposal was to create a modern, mobile-responsive, and sleek site. Addressing client concerns was the forefront of my approach, and I led an agile-style process of weekly client meetings and demos.",
    "I brought in several former students to collaborate with and create a team environment conducive to learning and applying skills taught in the bootcamp.",
